# VBA SchedulingTool

Final project for MSCI 100. This tool, designed for students, allows the user to create their schedule through UserForms in Excel. This tool is able to schedule tasks for the user automatically, but also allows the user to create specific timed events and recuring events. This tool also supports auto-recommendations based on a user's current schedule and encourages healthy habits through these reconemmendations.

Macros must be enabled for the tool to function.
